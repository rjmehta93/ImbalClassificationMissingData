# ImbalClassificationMissingData
Full Project on handling imbalanced binary classification problem with missing not at random data. Dataset is reated to healthcare coverage and target is to predict people who does not have healthcare coverage. 

## Key Highlights
Thorough exploratory analysis on data.
Handling missing not at random data. 
Extensive feature engineering.
Handling imabalance classifiaction through smote sampling and tweaking class weights.
Custom Metric (as F1 score metric in Caret R is not available) 
Challenge was not to use ensembling or stacking and getting best performance with single Random forest classifier only.
